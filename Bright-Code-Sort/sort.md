### Bubble

##### This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

<br />

### Insertion

##### The input list is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

<br />

### BinaryInsertion

#####  Uses binary search to find the proper location to insert the selected item at each iteration. 

<br />

### Selection

##### This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

<br />

### Quick

##### A Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

<br />

### Merge

##### A Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

<br />

### Tim
#### Merge sort and insertion sort

<br />

### Intro
#### Quicksort, Heapsort and Insertion Sort
